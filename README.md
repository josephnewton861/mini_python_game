# Pong (first python project)

## This project is my first using python and involves using pythons built in Turtle module. 

### Fell free to observe the source code and to clone the repository and to access the game run the command python mini-python-game/pong1.py in the terminal to access the game. 

## Game rules:

### The game consists of a board, two paddles either side of the board, a ball and two players.

#### The aim of the game is to hit the ball with your paddle to the opposing players side trying to make the opposing player try to miss the ball with their paddle.
#### Each time the player fails to hit the ball with their paddle a point via a scoring system at the top of the screen will give the opposing player a point. 
#### The game has a scoring limit of first to five points and will show you to the player who wins overall once that scoring limit is reached. 
#### If you want to play again you will need to re-run the command in the terminal. 

## Controlls: 

### Player 1: To access the paddles controls this player uses the a keyboard key to move the paddle up and the s keyboard key to move the paddle down.

### Player 2: To access the paddles controls this player uses the up keyboard arrow to move the paddle up and the down keyboard arrow to move the paddle down.
